## About

Kingdom of Choices is a cozy village game where players interact with NPCs, complete quests, and build relationships. The game features AI-powered dialogue that responds dynamically based on the player's relationships with NPCs and the context of ongoing quests.

## Game Rules

The goal of the game is to build strong relationships with the NPC characters. You can do this by talking to them or giving them gifts they appreciate. Each interaction affects your relationship status. When you have a good relationship with an NPC, they will be more likely to help you during quests that require assistance. 

AI is used to generate realistic and dynamic responses from NPCsâ€”whether you're having a casual conversation, offering them a gift, or asking for help on a quest.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Dialogue**: NPCs respond dynamically using AI language models
- **Relationship System**: Build relationships with villagers through interactions and gifts
- **Quest System**: Complete procedurally generated quests requiring item collection and NPC help
- **Tile-Based World**: Explore a village environment with interactive elements
- **Multiple NPCs**: Interact with unique characters including:
  - Tomo the blacksmith (grumpy but skilled)
  - Lira the flower shop owner (cheerful nature lover)
  - Anna the innkeeper (friendly but clumsy)
